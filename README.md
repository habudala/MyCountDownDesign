### Countdown Clock Update



####A countdown clock built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap3, and native JavaScript as an upgrade from the previous ones. It features three text boxes where the user can input the year, month and date from when they want to count down from, and hit "start". As an additional feature, I've added a "stop" button, so the clock can be stopped. It's a simple JavaScript exercise project of mine so I can practice working with the date object, and intervals.

##### - Added some media queries as the last step just to make this bad boy more responsive (beyond using bootstrap). It's more practice for me than anything else. I always welcome the opportunity to practice responsive design with media queries.
